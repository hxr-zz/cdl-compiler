Welcome to sayAnything CDL compiler.
------------------------

cdlcc is a compiler for the Certificate Description Language (CDL).
It generates C++ code from an input CDL source.

* Software requirements

- Flex
- Bison
- g++ (Gnu C++ compiler)
- Google Ctemplate (http://goog-ctemplate.sourceforge.net/)

-- If you are a developer then you need these additional packages

- Gnu Automake
- Gnu Autoconf

* To install:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

* To make a distribution

$ make distcheck

* To make emacs TAGS file(s):

$ make tags

* To uninstall:

$ make uninstall


* Usage instructions:

$ cdlcc [-s semantic-definition-file] [-o output-file] [-t code-template-file] INPUT-CDL-FILE

- All command line args are optional. If -o is not present, output will be written to stdout.

- When there is a Certificate definition in the grammar, you MUST supply a semantic-definition-file

- You can supply the location of a code template file. The default is /usr/share/sayAnything/Code.tpl

- INPUT-CDL must conform to the CDL grammar specificatoin.

* EXAMPLE

$ cdlcc -s certName.sem -o certName.cpp certName.certdef

- Will generate a C++ file called certName.cpp

- To compile this file, you need libsayAnything and libcrypto++ installed.

- Compile certName.cpp like this:

$ gcc -c certName.cpp -I/usr/include/sayAnything -lcrypto++ -lsayAnything -o certName.o


NOTE:
vector of vector of T (for any cdl type T) is not supported.
