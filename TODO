* Accuracy check

Implement a way to round off given value to the accuracy specified in the CDL.

* Recursive preprocessor

The current preprocessor is naive. It can only expand files once. 
Flex cannot generate reentrant scanners. So this has to be done iteratively 
or a third party regular expression library can be used.

* Support for multiple dimensions.

Array and Vector may have to support multiple dimensions in the future.
